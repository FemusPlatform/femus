 |- DATA : Physical properties

 |- runTest.sh : script that copies files from common to the test directory,
                 then executes the test
 
The FSI tests are performed for two different inflow speeds.
FSI1 is resulting in a steady state solution,
while the other two tests (FSI2, FSI3) result in periodic solutions
and correspond to the final benchmark settings.
